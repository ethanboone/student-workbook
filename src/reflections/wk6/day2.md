Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > How to use Props in Vue and answer the following questions
1. What are props?
Props are a piece of data that exists on a Vue component.
2. What are props used for?
Props are used to pass data or objects from a parent component to a child component.
3. Where can props be used or accessed?
Props exist on within a component, and the prop can be passed a child component but can only be modified on the parent element not from the child. The reasoning for this is to make it easier to debug.
