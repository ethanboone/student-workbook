Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Understanding Component Based Architecture and answer the following questions
1. What is Component based architecture?
Component based architecture is a design used to break down different specific pieces of the application to separate parts to maintain single responsibility.
2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
Utilizing components makes it much easier to render parts of the application multiple times with differing data. Similar to classes used with MVC in vanilla javascript, the components can be easily populated for different purposes throughout the app. Another advantage to using CBA is the components can be altered or changed and that specific component will be updated or added without reloading all other components or the entire page which makes the application run much more efficiently.
3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
Having too many components within a single page can affect the readibility and visual appeal of a webpage, as well as Component Based Architecture potentially being overutilized when parts of an application don't necessarily need to be individual components.
