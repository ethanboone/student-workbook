1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
Scrum on a larger team will likely have a broader array of features they're tackling at a given time. Smaller teams have less they can cover at a given time and have to organize their progress very well to be able to stay consistently productive.
2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
The quality of software will be sacrificed as the development teams will have greater difficulty creating cohesive code that integrates as anticipated.
3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle states that good service cheap won't be fast, good service fast won't be cheap, and fast service cheap won't be good. In SCRUM, its necessary to remain balanced in the middle of the triangle to maintain a good product at a reasonable pace.
