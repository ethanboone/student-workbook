## Daily Journal
Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions
What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We've been doing short SCRUM sprints every half a day to keep everyone on the same page and consistently reevaluate progress. What I've been working on has included a lot of mongoose queries and client side API requests.
What went well so far?
I feel like I've been learning a ton of information that's useful for making location based applications. I've been feeling a lot more comfortable writing server routes.
What would you do differently? Why?
Not anything I'd want to do different. The way our team has handled collaboration so far has been very productive.
