# Day 5

## Daily Journal
Overall, my first week at Codeworks was a great experience. It was my first time in a classroom environment since I was in highschool in 2018, but even though haven't engaged in any formal education, I still felt able to retain all of the new information and concepts rather well. While this first week didn't involve any programming outside of styling webpages, I still felt adequately challenged with the information we covered. I'm very excited for the coming weeks as we dive into building completed web applications.
