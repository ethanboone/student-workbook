# Day 1

What I learned in coding school is how to setup my environment.

## Daily Journal
Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > GIT 101 and answer the following questions
1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
The software Git is primarily used by developers to store their programs and code. Git saves to a local repository and a remote repository using cloud storage. Git also tracks the changes made to the code and allows you to access previous iterations as well.
2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Programmers utilize multiple branches with git to code multiple versions of the same program. It is often used to test specific changes to the code which can later be transferred over to the main branch, when the code is transferred it is referred to as a merge.
3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the program you run on your PC that saves your progress and pushes it to your local repository. In addition, git commits the updated program to the Github website and it stores it as a remote repository within cloud storage. Github allows developers to collaborate on projects together or access other's public programs.
