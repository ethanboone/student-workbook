Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide and answer the following questions
1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wire-framing is process of creating a minimal design of a website. It's used to get feedback from users, gain ideas for design direction, and get a rough draft for the initial website template.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
The three quality levels for wire-framing are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Low fidelity wireframes generally aren't close to a finished product and are rough outlines of what the final design will contain. Mid-fidelity wire-frames are the most commonly used in the design process. They contain key components while in black and white but exclude details that aren't top priority. Lastly, High-fidelity wire-frames are closer to the real deal and include smaller details and aspects low and mid-fidelity wireframes wouldn't contain. They are generally used later in the design process when developers have a clear direction and vision for the completed website.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Yes I do believe wireframes are worth the resources put into creating them. They are a crucial step in finalizing the layout, design, and features the finished product will have. Without wire-framing, I imagine many aspects of the website will need to still need to be modified throughout development or just get scrapped entirely for a new design.
