# Day 3

## Daily Journal
Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Cheating At Design and answer the following questions
1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
I thought it was very useful to think about how "Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance" as the article says it. This specific tip stood out to me to utilize in my own designs, to determine the importance of a specific button before assigning it a background color. Primary functions of the website call for colorful buttons that stand out, but aspects of the page that aren't necessarily at the forefront of the website's functionality don't require carefully stylized buttons.
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I would imagine deliberately styled features on a web page could likely influence the way a user chooses to navigate the website. Consciously or not, these designs would make them more likely to engage with those features as bright colors and buttons would be more likely to capture the users attention.
