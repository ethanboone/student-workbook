## Daily Journal
Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions
1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
I definitely made sure to use the partner programming tactics to make it a more efficient development process.
2. What went well?
It went well having the 'navigator' catch simple syntax errors and keep the coding process continue smoothly with less debugging.
3. What would you do differently?
I would switch more often to keep both the 'driver' and the 'navigator' more engaged with what part of the functionality is being worked on.
