Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Pair Programming and answer the following questions
1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is where two programmers share the same computer, where one is "driving" and one is "navigating".
2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Increases the quality of the code being written as having two people looking at the same program as more solutions for a single issue are available as well as catching more typos and syntax errors having two people looking at the same screen.
3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
Sometimes two developers just have different approaches/coding style or they just don't get along well in general. It can also not be as useful if the driver isn't talking through the code and what they're writing throughout the process.
