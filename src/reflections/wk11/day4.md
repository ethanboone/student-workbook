# Day 4

## Daily Journal
Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has seemingly flown by, it feels like I just started a couple weeks ago and now my class is wrapping up with our final and career week. I really enjoyed working on my capstone and checkpoints, completing applications and projects was incredibly gratifying. It was difficult, stressful, and a bit overwhelming at times but I learned a lot throughout the course and it was a generally positive experience. I'm definitely looking forward to getting a job and beginning my career as a developer.
