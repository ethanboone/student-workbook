1. Why is communication on a small team important?
In a small group of developers, communication is extremely vital in keeping everyone on the same page and to make continuous progress towards the finished application.
2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
You have to balance keeping the client updated while not encroaching on the developers productivity which is more difficult when there are fewer developers.
3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
It's the fallbacks of trying to meet deadlines at a faster pace than what is ideal. The sides of the unattainable triangle specify that good service won't be fast, good service fast won't be cheap, and fast service cheap won't be good.
