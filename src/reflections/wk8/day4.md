Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions
1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit testing which is testing individual features of the app, component testing is using frameworks specfically for vue to verify each component in the app is properly working, and end to end is testing the application as the user interacting with it.
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think unit testing would probably be the most efficient as testing features of your app in code will break up testing into separate pieces but still remains logical in the division of each individual testing step.
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
It seems that end to end would be the least efficient given a short amount of time or without designated QA employees to test the application.
