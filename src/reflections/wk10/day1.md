Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions
1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
The types of data in C# are value type, reference type, and pointer type. Value type is a data type that holds it's value in it's own memory space, referece stores a value that references another place in memory, and pointer types contains a referent type and pointers cannot be converted at all and only unmanaged types can be the referent type.
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
For example bool, int, char, and byte are all value data types. They seem to be similar to javascript but have less flexibility and are more specific.
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference types have a key but don't directly store a value the way value types do, they instead reference another place in memory where the data is being stored.
