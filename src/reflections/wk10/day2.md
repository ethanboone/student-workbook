Read Foundations of C# > C# List and answer the following questions
1. What is a List in C#?
A list is a collection of data, but the data within the list must be the same data type.
2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.Add, List.Contains, List.Find and List.FindAll are all methods I could see being useful.
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
If you're looking for a specific property, Find/FindAll would be helpful. If you know what index you are accessing you could just use bracket notation given the index.
