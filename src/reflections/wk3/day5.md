# Day 5

## Daily Journal
The beginning of this week was rather difficult, especially compared to the javascript week, as I had used javascript quite a bit during the intro course and I had never used a design pattern like MVCS. Throughout the week, I felt more and more comfortable using MVC from the afternoon challenges. The checkpoint was a bit more challenging than I expected. I worked through most of the logic by the end of Friday, and I was busy on Saturday so I finished up the rest of the project by around 4 today (Sunday). Specifically, I had some trouble getting my tasks load to the specific list they belong to, as well as getting my tasks to draw to the page on reload. I was getting really frustrated earlier because i couldn't figure out why my tasks weren't loading until I looked at my local storage file and saw my lists didn't include the id argument pulled from local storage. Essentially my lists would load with a new Id which wouldn't match my task's list Id. It took me hours to figure out where it was breaking at, but I worked through it and found the cause of the issue.
