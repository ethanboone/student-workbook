Read Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript and answer the following questions
1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
The purpose of encapsulation is to restrict access to variables and the methods that utilize those variables so the methods/functions can't be modified by other code in the program.
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
Often times developers would use an underscore before methods or functions to specify that they were intended to be private. The issue with that is that many developers aren't aware of that and still modify them as well as devs who are and knowingly use the code.
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
Using Closure or private fields with babel can be used for creating private information.
