# Day 1

## Daily Journal
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

Today I began working on client side and began scaffolding out the necessary vue and javascript files. I still am missing a few postman tests but I completed a good majority of the back end and just have some final touches to add to pass the tests.
