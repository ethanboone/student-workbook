# Day 4

## Daily Journal
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

Today I worked on styling and a couple other minor modifications to my final. After working on the final project for a bit I began working on a landing page with my portfolio.
