# Day 2

## Daily Journal
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I worked very long hours today and am very close to getting my project to a passing grade. I was coding until about midnight and I plan on getting graded first thing tomorrow. I completed all of my vue pages and components and everything is functional and complete with the exception of the design requirements.
