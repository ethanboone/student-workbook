# Day 3

## Daily Journal
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I got graded not long after arriving at school, and I was missing 4 requirements on the project. I finished up the last couple features and got regraded about 30 minutes later, and ended up passing all requirements with the exception of the design requirements. I plan on styling a little bit more throughout the week and after the course to make the project one of my portfolio projects.
