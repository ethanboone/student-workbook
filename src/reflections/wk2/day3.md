Read Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions
1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
The console is very useful for evaluating conditionals, looking over information or errors that were logged to the console, view data from javascript files, and testing functions or functionality.
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab is what is used to view or modify the html and css. This tab is incredibly useful for working out kinks in your html and css as modifying the code with the dev tools automatically updates your webpage. It is important to note changes made with the dev tools must be added to your files as what you write on the web page won't be saved and will be gone if the page refreshes.
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
Utilizing the sources tabs is a great way to fix errors in your program. It has a built in debugger that you can use to add break points to find where your code isn't functioning as it should.
