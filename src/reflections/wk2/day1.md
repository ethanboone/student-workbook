Read Intro to JS > Var, let and const and answer the following questions
1. What is Scope ?
Scope is the area that a variable's value is defined. There are two kinds of scope in Javascript: global and local. When a variable is declared outside of a function then the value of that variable remains throughout the whole page. If a variable is declared within a function then it's value is only set within the confines of the specific variable.
2. What is Hoisting ?
The term hoisting refers to variables being declared at the top of the variable's scope. For global variables, they would be declared at the top of the javascript file. Local variables will be before the rest of a functions code block. 
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
Let would be used in instances the variable may be redefined throughout your program. Const sets a value that cannot be altered throughout the program. Var however, is the previous keyword for declaring a variable before ES6 and is function scoped opposed to let and const being block scope.
