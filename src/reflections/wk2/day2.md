Didn't get as much done as I had hoped, got stuck on a stretch goal for arrays.
## Daily Journal
Read Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions
1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
You can write a function by naming it with a function declaration, make a function expression which is used to create a function that isn't given a name, or write a function with more straightforward syntax using arrow functions. Some examples of differences between each of them are function declarations are able to be used before they are defined but function expressions must be defined prior to them being utilized, and arrow functions don't have their own this value like function declarations or expressions have.
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are the keywords that are stated in the function declaration and used as a placeholder for a value that has not yet been defined. When a function is invoked, arguments are provided between the parentheses and give a value to the parameters to be used when the function is executed.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
When a function contains another function as its parameter its considered a high order function. An example of how high order functions are used in programming would be array.prototype.map, which is used to create a new array with the results of a function that executes on each index or element of the array that is called on.
