# Day 5

## Daily Journal
Javascript week was a bit more challenging that week one, creating entire applications rather than just mocking up static websites with bootstrap requires a bit more effort. I didn't feel like I was really struggling overall, but there were times during the afternoon challenges where I would get stuck. Overcoming the issues in my code definitely helped solidify my Javascript knowledge, and helped me feel more comfortable with writing program functionality.
