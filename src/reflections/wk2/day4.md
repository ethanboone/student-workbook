Read Intro to JS > The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer and answer the following questions
1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
As the article states, high quality code needs to be properly planned out and structured accordingly as coding is a way of communicating your thoughts. Having a plan going into your code gives your program the opportunity to be more readable, easier to debug, and easier to maintain.
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
The article explains how searching for the first correct solution to your code is often a misstep, professional developing is about finding the best solution out of many. It says that if you can't find multiple solutions to your problem, then you more than likely don't fully understand the problem. You must identify the solution that performs well enough, is as easy to read as possible, as well as as easy to maintain as possible.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
I found it really insightful that you don't necessarily want to choose the first solution to a problem that you find, as more often than not there is at least one better solution to the same issue. I also liked the part about writing code while keeping in mind how difficult it will be to maintain. Overall the article has a lot of relevant tips that can be used to become a better programmer.
